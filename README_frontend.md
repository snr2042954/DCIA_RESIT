# Streamlit Frontend for ALS-Based Microgoal Recommendation System

This Streamlit app provides an interactive frontend to explore personalized microgoal mastery and recommendations generated by an ALS-based student modeling pipeline.

It allows instructors or students to visualize completed tasks, receive tailored skip recommendations, and view model evaluation metrics like confusion matrices and classification accuracy.

---

## App Overview

The frontend supports:

1. **Student Selection**  
   Choose a student from the dataset and inspect their mastery.

2. **Completed Microgoals Viewer**  
   View microgoals where the studentâ€™s ELO exceeds a configurable threshold (e.g., 1.0).

3. **Microgoal Recommendations**  
   See which unseen microgoals the student is predicted to have already mastered (safe to skip).

4. **Model Evaluation (Optional)**  
   Run a demo evaluation using a train/test split to show accuracy, F1, and a confusion matrix.

## File Description

### `streamlit_app.py`

Main Streamlit app to run the frontend.

- Loads student-microgoal matrix and trained ALS model
- Offers user interface for selecting student and viewing:
  - Completed microgoals (actual ELO)
  - Recommended microgoals to skip (predicted ELO)
- Provides interactive visualizations:
  - Bar chart of top recommendations
  - Confusion matrix with metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- Allows threshold tuning via sliders
- Explains results via interactive tabs or expanders

### `asset folder`

Contains one sole image which is used in the streamlit app

### `requirements.txt`

Contains the requirements to run app.py

## Visual Features

- **Heatmap**: Shows actual vs predicted ELO scores for selected student  
- **Bar Chart**: Highlights predicted-to-be-mastered microgoals  
- **Classification Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score  
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows tp, tn, fp, fn rates in a visul format.
- **Interactive Tabs**: Explain true/false positives and negatives
